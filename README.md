# StopWatch (a WIP)!

Exploring Angular basics, I've built a hands-on mobile-responsive Stop Watch web app. Give it a try [here](https://stop-watch-47349.web.app/)!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

### Features being worked on:
- Light Mode Theme
- Keyboard Shortcuts
- Countdown Timer
